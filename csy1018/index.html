		<h1>Who are you?</h1>
		<p>Hello! Like I said in the column to the left, my name is Aidan. I'm a 19 year old student at the University of Northampton, and I'm thoroughly enjoying my time here.</p>
		<p>I have been into computers for many years, over a decade now. Computers have basically been a part of my life since I was born, starting with my parents' Packard Bell Club PC.</p>
		<p>It looked something like this: (my original machine is now long gone)</p>
		<a href="https://www.gumtree.com/p/desktop-workstation-pcs/packard-bell-club-550-computer-/1296592988"><img src="packard.jpg" alt="An image of my first computer."></a> <!--Here, an image is referenced to the source using an a tag. This turns the entire image into a web link.-->
		<p><i>Click image for source.</i></p>
		<p>It introduced me to the world of Windows 98FE and PC gaming, including PC Play and Learn, of which I still have a lot of discs for. Years and years on from then I still tinker with PCs in my spare time, from new to old. I recently rebuilt a far more capable machine based on the same CPU of my first PC, a Pentium II, and put it into the case of the first PC I ever bought myself, an Acer Aspire M1610.</p>
		<p>It looks like this:</p>

		<p><i>Click image for source.</i></p>
		<p>And from there, the sky is the limit.</p>

		<h1>Site Purpose</h1>
		<p>This site is being developed as part of the University of Northampton CSY1018 Web Development course.</p>
		<img src="broken.png" alt="An example pixelart copy of the IE6 broken image logo, made by me.">
		<p>As part of this course, I am being asked to write a website in a newspaper layout, akin to something like The New York Times.</p>
		<p>The site needs to have five pages, which are:</p>
		<ul> <!--Starts an unordered list. It is set to align to the left of the document, or in this case, the column, in the CSS.-->
			<li>Landing page (index.html)</li> <!--li is used to create a bullet-pointed list.-->
			<li>Reviews (reviews.html)</li>
			<li>Glossary (glossary.html)</li>
			<li>Jobs (jobs.html)</li>
			<li>Tutorials (tutorials.html)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You can find links to these pages above, using the toolbar. The toolbar will light up blue according to the page you are on.</p>
	</div>

		<h1>Useful Links</h1>
		<p>You can find some useful links here, for instance the CSS file, the GitHub page, my personal GitHub page, and other things.</p>
