					<p>If you're looking at this message right now, you've somehow made your way to my website!</p>

					my interests as an individual, but also my potential career prospects.</p>
					
					<p>If you're interested in finding out about me, you can access each of my pages using the nav bar above. However, if you're instead interested in my presence on social media, you can
					access my social media profiles using the links provided in the sidebar.</p>
